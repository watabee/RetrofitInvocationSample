# Retrofit Invocation Sample

This is a sample project using [Retrofit Invocation class](https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-250-2018-11-18).

>New: Invocation class provides a reference to the invoked method and argument list as a tag on the underlying OkHttp Call. This can be accessed from an OkHttp interceptor for things like logging, analytics, or metrics aggregation.
